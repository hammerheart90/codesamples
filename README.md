Coding Samples from Academic and Extracurricular Work

These contain coding samples from several projects over my academic career. 

The first set is some Python coding from my time at UCD. Some of the Python dependencies and libraries have been updated since the code was written, but it should give a good example of my experience working with Python functions and libraries if it doesn't execute flawlessly.

The second is a little more recent, and contains some simple Visual C# programs that have been translated over to Python. I've attached the C# and the equivalent Python files together. The comments should give a good idea of their purpose. Additionally, there's a Python file in that set that demonstrates some simple list comprehension.
